- Infection vulnerability for PLHIV?
- Reinfection rate depending on D1_gD2?


What happened with development?
Two main things
1. What is the timestep?
2. If it has been normalized? Full numbers?

-> Have we ever checked the validity of the probabilistic rescaling?

From a maths point of view, spd_infxness 
susceptibles * infected * this number

First parameter we start with is spd_infxness

1. start with spd_infxness
2. change probability of early-late vs early-active
3. change reinfection rate

Probability of activating is higher in PLHIV? 0.2 means that every 5 years, people stop being early?

Countries keep coming back to the fact that incidence is decreasing? 

Higher probability in the first year

TODO-
- Write up avg_contacts_in documentation
- Do pop conversion for Gates
DONE - add multi-pop SIR example
DONE - test vars_by_pop and update calibration output None type
- bring vars_by_pop, new scenarios, and new calibrations, back to TB
	- Pending merge
